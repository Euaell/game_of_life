# Conway's Game of Life - React Web Version

A beautiful, interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life built with React and Vite. This cellular automaton demonstrates how simple rules can create complex, fascinating patterns.

## 🎮 Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click cells to toggle them alive/dead before starting the simulation
- **Customizable Dimensions**: Set grid size from 5x5 to 100x100 cells
- **Real-time Controls**: Start, stop, reset, and randomize the simulation
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback when interacting with cells
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- **Generation Counter**: Track how many generations have passed
- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant transitions and cell birth animations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or 20+
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the web version:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd game_of_life/web_version
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

## 📖 How to Play

1. **Set Dimensions**: When you first load the app, choose your grid size (minimum 5x5)
2. **Design Initial Pattern**: Click cells to toggle them alive (blue) or dead (white)
3. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to begin the cellular automaton
4. **Watch Evolution**: Observe how your pattern evolves according to the Game of Life rules
5. **Control the Game**: Use the controls to stop, reset, or randomize the grid

### Game Controls

- **Start/Stop**: Begin or pause the simulation
- **Reset**: Clear the grid and return to generation 0
- **Randomize**: Fill the grid with random living cells
- **Change Dimensions**: Modify the grid size at any time

## 🧬 Game of Life Rules

The Game of Life follows four simple rules:

1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies
2. **Survival**: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on to the next generation
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### Using Docker

A Dockerfile is provided for easy containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t game-of-life-web .

# Run the container
docker run -p 80:80 game-of-life-web
```

### Deploy to Popular Platforms

- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel for automatic deployments
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder to Netlify
- **GitHub Pages**: Use the built-in Actions for automatic deployment
- **Firebase Hosting**: Use `firebase deploy` after building

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Game Speed

Edit the interval in `App.tsx`:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  updateGrid();
}, 200); // Change 200ms to your preferred speed
```

### Modifying Cell Appearance

Edit the CSS in `Cell.css` to change colors, sizes, or animations:
```css
.cell.alive {
  background: #007bff; /* Change this color */
}
```

### Adding New Patterns

You can modify the randomize function or add preset patterns in `App.tsx`.

## 🔧 Technical Details
